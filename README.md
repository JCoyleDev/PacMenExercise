# PacMenExercise
The goal of the PacMen exercise was to create a simple game where the user can generate images of PacMan and have them bounce around the screen. 

How To Run:
-Add as many PacMen as you'd like to the screen by clicking the "Add PacMan" button in the upper left-hand corner
-Click "Start Game"

Future Improvements:
-Having the PacMen eat orbs that also float around the screen
-Add in ghosts
